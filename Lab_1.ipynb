To do this we will take a period of weather data from two weather stations - one in downtown Vancouver, and one well outside of the city - and compare them to see if we can detect any variations that might suggest the presence of an Urban Heat Island effect in Vancouver. Have a look at the companion paper noted above and provided with the lab for some idea of how this work is done in real life. Specifically, the technical term for the variable or *parameter* that we will use is *screen-height, dry-bulb air temperature* - in particular, we will use daily maximum and daily minimum data. *Screen-height* means 1.5m above the ground, which is a World Meteorological Organization standard, and *dry-bulb* is what most people would consider \"normal\" air temperature, but is specifically separated from two other parameters *wet-bulb air temperature* and *dew-point temperature*. \n","\n","Our pedagogical learning objective is the following: to start learning how to use data to analyse examine a physical problem. This will involve taking raw data and \"reducing\" it, or performing analyses on it using python commands and codde, to generate results (plots, statistical analyses) that will allow us to draw conclusions about the phenomenon under investigation. \n","\n","Our technical/python learning objectives are the following: \n","1. How to read in data from a text file\n","2. how to start spotting errors in the data\n","3. How to handle dates\n","4. How to make basic plots\n","5. How to reduce data for analysis\n","6. How to do a basic student's t-test\n","\n","***\n","### Import modules\n","The first thing we do is usually importing modules you will need. A module is a library that contains the functions necessary to run your code. A function is a small piece of code that performs a specific task. An example is `print()`. It will print to the display window whatever you tell it. A function always has `()`. In the parentheses you put the argument for the function. A function does not always need an argument, but it must have the `()` (that is, they can be empty).  \n","\n","Typically we start a program by importing whatever modules you will need and usually we give them a simplified \"handle\", just because it gets cumbersome to always type the name of the module. We have to use the module name whenever we request a function from that module. `print()` is core to all python and it doesn't belong to a library, so it is just `print()`. But - a speacilized reader that we use from the `pandas` library, `read_csv()`, must be called like `pandas.read_csv()`. A handle shortens that. \n","\n","Note the handle could be anything. You could say \n","`import pandas as p`\n","and then any pandas functions would be called like: \n","`junk_data = p.read_csv(\"1100030.ascii\")`\n","But we'll use pd because that is sort of a convention, so use `import pandas as pd`.\n","\n","### Reference information\n","<b>Nice intro discussion about pandas, with tutorials no less! _Strongly_ encouraged to look at the tutorials...</b> https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html\n","<b>This also has nice intro guides:</b> https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html\n","<b>pandas dataframe object reference documentation found here:</b>https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html\n","<b>pandas general reference documentation found here:</b> https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html <br>\n","\n","<b>pinguoin reference documentation found here:</b> https://pingouin-stats.org/index.html <br>\n","\n","<b>pinguoin ttest reference documentation found here:</b> https://pingouin-stats.org/generated/pingouin.ttest.html#pingouin.ttest\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"65vI-x38PZU_"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hb2zxHvbPZVB"},"source":["Make a copy of the datasets on a local drive. \n","\n","Now you will enter the code required to read an external set of data into memory in a format that python understands. But before typing python code, you should always open your raw data in a text viewer. I strongly recommend a program called `notepad ++`. Exmaining the file in `notepad ++` reveals three important points:  \n","\n","1. The data are \"human-readable\", which helps us guide how we will read it into python.\n","2. Individual data values are separated by commas (a \"comma separated value\" or .csv file), which further helps guide us to a reading strategy.\n","3. There are two \"header\" lines: the first is kind of a throwaway bit of info, but the second header line is important to take note of because it contains the names of the variables that will be automatically assigned if we choose. This information will additionally refine our strategy for reading in the data. \n","\n","There are many ways to read files into a computer. In this case, because we have noted it is a comma separated file, we can use a pandas command `read_csv`.

This an \"assignment\" statement in python (or any language). **The equals sign here is not a mathematical equivalency statement.** It simply tells python to make a spot in memory - a variable - and call it \"stn1\" and store the results of the read_csv statment there. \n","2. It probably didn't work for you just like this. You need to specify a path that leads the computer to that specific file.
